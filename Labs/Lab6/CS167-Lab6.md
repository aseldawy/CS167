# Lab 6

## Objectives

* Getting started with using Scala to access Spark RDD and Spark SQL.
* Use the Dataframe (SparkSQL) API to process semi-structured data.
* Use SQL queries to process CSV files.
* Run your Scala and SparkSQL program in remote cluster.

---

## Prerequisites

* Setup the development environment as explained in [Lab 1](../Lab1/CS167-Lab1.md).
* Same as [Lab 5](../Lab5/CS167-Lab5.md), download these two sample files [nasa_19950801.tsv](../Lab4/nasa_19950801.tsv), [nasa_19950630.22-19950728.12.tsv.gz](../Lab3/nasa_19950630.22-19950728.12.tsv.gz). Decompress the second file after download. These are the same files we used in previous Labs: [Lab 3](../Lab3/CS167-Lab3.md) and [Lab 4](../Lab4/CS167-Lab4.md).
* To add Scala language support to IntelliJ, you can install the [Scala plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala). Please check the [plugin management page](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html) to see the details about installing and managing plugins in Intellij. Make sure you restart IntelliJ after installing the plugin.

* If you are not yet familiar with Scala, please check [this tutorial](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/scala-for-java-programmers.html) to help with the transition from Java to Scala.

## Overview

In this lab, we will use Scala for programming. While pure Scala projects are usually set up using [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org), we will use Maven for this project to reuse your existing development environment and avoid the complications of setting up a new development tool. According to the [official Scala documentation](https://www.scala-lang.org) 'Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language.' Since big-data systems rely heavily on functional programming, Scala is an excellent match for big-data. This is why Spark is natively written in Scala. If you excel in Scala, you can write more concise and readable code and become more productive.

The lab has two parts. The first part implements some operations using the Scala RDD API. The second part repeats the same operations using SparkSQL. This allows you to contrast and understand the difference between them.

---

## Lab Work

## Part A. Spark RDD

### I. Project Setup (10 minutes) (In home)

This part will be done on your `local` machine.

1. Generate a new Maven project that works with `Scala`. Use the following command (Please note that this command is different from the previous Labs):

    ```bash
    mvn archetype:generate "-DarchetypeGroupId=net.alchim31.maven" "-DarchetypeArtifactId=scala-archetype-simple" "-DgroupId=edu.ucr.cs.cs167.[UCRNetID]" "-DartifactId=[UCRNetID]_lab6" -B
    ```
    *Note* : Do not forget to replace `[UCRNetID]` with your UCR Net ID. If you cannot run the above command, check [this alternative approach](#create-lab-6-project-from-intellij).

2. Import your project into IntelliJ IDEA in the same way you did in previous labs and make sure it compiles.

3. In your `pom.xml` **replace** the properties, depdendencies, and build sections with the following configurations:

    ```xml
    <!-- Replace Properties -->
    <properties>
      <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
      <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
      <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
      <scala.version>2.12.18</scala.version>
      <spark.version>3.5.4</spark.version>
      <scala.compat.version>2.12</scala.compat.version>
      <spec2.version>4.20.5</spec2.version>
    </properties>

    <!-- Replace Dependencies -->
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
        <artifactId>spark-core_${scala.compat.version}</artifactId>
        <version>${spark.version}</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.scala-lang</groupId>
        <artifactId>scala-library</artifactId>
        <version>${scala.version}</version>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <!-- Replace Build -->
    <build>
      <sourceDirectory>src/main/scala</sourceDirectory>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>net.alchim31.maven</groupId>
          <artifactId>scala-maven-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>3.3.2</version>
          <executions>
            <execution>
              <goals>
                <goal>compile</goal>
              </goals>
              <configuration>
                <args>
                  <arg>-dependencyfile</arg>
                  <arg>${project.build.directory}/.scala_dependencies</arg>
                </args>
              </configuration>
            </execution>
          </executions>
        </plugin>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>2.21.0</version>
          <configuration>
            <skipTests>true</skipTests>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </build>
    ```
    *Note*: Click the floating ***m*** icon, or **synchronize your maven project** (like in previous Labs) to load all dependencies.

4. Run the main function in `App` class in IntelliJ IDEA to make sure it works. You should see your program `exit with code 0` (normal exit). 
In addition, in your local machine command line, go to your `[UCRNetID_lab6]` directory and type `mvn package` to make sure your project can generate a `.jar` file.

5. This Lab requires you to implement multiple functionalities: `count-all`, `time-filter`, and `avg-bytes-by-code`. Therefore, it is recommanded to `setup all configurations inadvance`. You can refer to [here](#intellij-configurations) for how to do this.

---

### II. Initialize with Spark RDD (5 minutes) (In home)

This part will be done on your `local` machine.

In this part, you will initialize your project with Spark.

1. In `App` class, write the following stub code.

    ```Scala
    // Remember to change UCRNetID to your net id
    package edu.ucr.cs.cs167.<UCRNetID> 

    import org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD
    import org.apache.spark.{SparkConf, SparkContext}

    import scala.collection.Map
    import scala.io.StdIn

    object App {

      def main(args: Array[String]) {
        val command: String = args(0) 
        val inputfile: String = args(1)

        val conf = new SparkConf
        if (!conf.contains("spark.master"))
          conf.setMaster("local[*]")
        println(s"Using Spark master '${conf.get("spark.master")}'")
        conf.setAppName("CS167_Lab6_App")
        val sparkContext = new SparkContext(conf)
        
        try {
          val inputRDD: RDD[String] = sparkContext.textFile(inputfile)

          // TODO 1a: skip the first line

          // TODO 1b: parse each line

          val t1 = System.nanoTime
          var valid_command = true
          command match {

            // TODO 2: count-all code

            // TODO 3: time-filter code

            // TODO 4: avg-bytes-by-code code

            case _ => valid_command = false
          }
          val t2 = System.nanoTime
          if (valid_command) {
            println(s"Command '$command' on file '$inputfile' finished in ${(t2 - t1) * 1E-9} seconds")
            if(!sparkContext.master.startsWith("local")) {
              println("Press Enter to exit (you can access http://localhost:4040 while this is running)...")
              StdIn.readLine()
            }
          }
          else
            Console.err.println(s"Invalid command '$command'")
        } finally {
          sparkContext.stop
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Note: Unlike the switch statement in C and Java, the [match statement](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html) in Scala does not require a break at the end of each case.

2. Take a few minutes to check the stub code and understand what it does. It has two required command-line arguments.
    * ***(Q1) What are these two arguments?***

---

### III. Read and parse the input file (Part A) (10 minutes) (In home)

This part will be done in your `local` machine.

1. Since the first line of [nasa_19950801.tsv](../Lab4/nasa_19950801.tsv) and [nasa_19950630.22-19950728.12.tsv.gz](../Lab3/nasa_19950630.22-19950728.12.tsv.gz) do not contain actual useful records, we need to skip the first line. You can use a filter transformation to skip the first line. For simplicity, you can assume the first line starts with `"host\tlogname"`:  
    * Copy and complete the following code for `TODO 1a`:
      ```scala
      val validLines: RDD[String] = // TODO 1a: filter lines which do not start with "host\tlogname" from `inputRDD`
      ```

2. Parse each line of the filtered input by `"\t"`. You can use a map transformation to split each line by separator `"\t"`.
    * Copy and complete the following code for `TODO 1b`:
      ```scala
      val parsedLines: RDD[Array[String]] = // TODO 1b: split each line by "\t" from `validLines` via `map`
      ```

Note that since the filter and map operations are transformations, not actions, none of them will be executed until you use them.

A few commands in the next sections may require more than 2 arguments.

---

### IV. Implement `count-all` (10 minutes)

1. The `count-all` command should use the method [`RDD#count`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/RDD.html#count():Long) which is an action to count the total number of records in the input file.
    * Copy and complete the following code for `TODO 2: count all code`:
      ```scala
            case "count-all" => // Count total number of records in the file
              val count: Long = // TODO 2: count total number of records in the file on `parsedLines`
              println(s"Total count for file '$inputfile' is $count")
      ```
    
2. Run and test: If you followed the configuration [here](#intellij-configurations), you can directly choose and run `App/A1.count-all`. Otherwise, you need to specify arguments as `count-all nasa_19950801.tsv`.

    Below is the expected output for the two sample files.
      ```text
      Total count for file 'nasa_19950801.tsv' is 30969
      ```
    *Note*: You can ignore the WARN or INFO shown in your output results.

---

### V. `time-filter` (10 minutes)

1. In this part, we need to count the number of lines that have a timestmap in a given range `[start, end]`:
2. The interval is given as two additional arguments as integers.

      *Note*: Do not forget to use the method [`String#toLong`](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.13.6/scala/collection/StringOps.html#toLong:Long) in Scala to convert the String argument to a long integer to enable numeric comparison.

3. Copy and complete the following code for `TODO 3: time-filter`:
    ```scala
      case "time-filter" =>
        // Filter by time range [from = args(2), to = args(3)], and print the total number of matching lines

        val from: Long = // TODO: read from timestamp
        val to: Long = // TODO read to timestamp

        val filteredLines: RDD[Array[String]] = // TODO 3: `filter` on  `parsedLines` by time (column 2) with `from` and `to`
      
        val count: Long = filteredLines.count()
        println(s"Total count for file '$inputfile' in time range [$from, $to] is $count")
    ```

4. You will need a filter followed by count to complete this part. The filter will be:

    ```scala
    val time = line(2).toLong
    time >= from && time <= to
    ```
    * Note: In Scala, the keyword `val` declares a constant while the keyword `var` declares a variable.

5. Run your code with `A2.time-filter` configuration or with arguments: `time-filter nasa_19950801.tsv 807274014 807283738`:

    The sample output are shown below:
      ```text
      Total count for file 'nasa_19950801.tsv' in time range [807274014, 807283738] is 6389
      ```

---

### VI. `avg-bytes-by-code` (15 minutes)

1. This method will calculate the average bytes for each response code.
2. You can copy and complete the following code:
    ```scala
        case "avg-bytes-by-code" =>
          // Group the liens by response code and calculate the average bytes per group
          val loglinesByCode: RDD[(String, Long)] =  // TODO 4a: `map` on `parsedLines` by response code (column 5) and bytes (column 6)
          val sums: RDD[(String, Long)] = // TODO 4b: `reduceByKey` on `loglinesByCode`
          val counts: Map[String, Long] = // TODO 4c: `countByKey` on `loglinesByCode`
          println(s"Average bytes per code for the file '$inputfile'")
          println("Code,Avg(bytes)")
          sums.sortByKey().collect().foreach(pair => {
            val code = pair._1
            val sum = pair._2
            val count = counts(code)
            println(s"$code,${sum.toDouble / count}")
          })
    ```
2. To do that, you can first use the [`map`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/RDD.html#map[U](f:T=>U)(implicitevidence$3:scala.reflect.ClassTag[U]):org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[U]) function to produce only the `code` and the `bytes`.
    * Complete `TODO 4a`

3. Then, you can use the mehod [`reducyByKey`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/PairRDDFunctions.html#reduceByKey(func:(V,V)=>V):org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[(K,V)]) to compute the summation. The reduce method is Spark is different than the reduce method in Hadoop. Instead of taking all the values, it only takes two values at a time. To compute the summation, your reduce function should return the sum of the two values given to it. You can find a helpful hint from this [stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36965338/spark-scala-understanding-reducebykey).
    * Complete `TODO 4b` and `TODO 4c`

4. Since reduceByKey is a transformation, we need to use the [`collect`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/RDD.html#collect():Array[T]) action to get the results back.

5. Since we need to compute the average, a simple reduce function cannot be used to compute the average since the average function is not associative. However, it can be computed using a combination of sum and count.

6. The easiest way to compute the average is to combine the output of the two steps. The average is simply the sum divided by count. We provided the code and you can spend some time in understanding its logic:
  ```scala
    sums.sortByKey().collect().foreach(pair => {
      val code = pair._1
      val sum = pair._2
      val count = counts(code)
      println(s"$code,${sum.toDouble / count}")
    })
  ```

    [OPTIONAL] The drawback of the above method is that it will need to scan the input twice to count each function, sum and count. It is possible to compute both functions in one scan over the input and without caching any intermediate RDDs. Hint, check the [aggregateByKey](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/PairRDDFunctions.html#aggregateByKey[U](zeroValue:U)(seqOp:(U,V)=>U,combOp:(U,U)=>U)(implicitevidence$3:scala.reflect.ClassTag[U]):org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD[(K,U)]) function. This [stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40087483/spark-average-of-values-instead-of-sum-in-reducebykey-using-scala) may also be helpful.

7. Run `A3.avg-bytes-by-code` or passing arguments `avg-bytes-by-code nasa_19950801.tsv`. 
A sample output is shown below.
    ```text
    Average bytes per code for the file 'nasa_19950801.tsv'
    Code,Avg(bytes)
    200,17230.604247104246
    302,73.25352112676056
    304,0.0
    404,0.0
    ```

---


## Part B. Spark SQL

In this part, you will implement the same functionalities as above by using SparkSQL to see the difference. If you are not familiar with SQL, check this [SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/).

### I. Project Setup (1 minute) (In home)

1. In the `pom.xml` file, add the following dependency.

    ```xml
    <!-- Add this within <dependencies> </dependencies> -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>
      <artifactId>spark-sql_${scala.compat.version}</artifactId>
      <version>${spark.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

### II. Initialize a SparkSession (5 minutes) (In home)

Create a new Scala class of type **Object** named `AppSQL`. Add the following stub code to `AppSQL`:

```scala
package edu.ucr.cs.cs167.<UCRNetID> // Do not forget this line

import org.apache.spark.SparkConf
import org.apache.spark.sql.{DataFrame, Row, SparkSession}
import scala.io.StdIn

object AppSQL {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    val conf = new SparkConf
    if (!conf.contains("spark.master"))
      conf.setMaster("local[*]")
    println(s"Using Spark master '${conf.get("spark.master")}'")

    val spark = SparkSession
      .builder()
      .appName("CS167_Lab6_AppSQL")
      .config(conf)
      .getOrCreate()

    val command: String = args(0)
    val inputfile: String = args(1)
    try {
      val input = // TODO 5: -- read input file as a Spark DataFrame
      input.show()

      // TODO 6: print the DataFrame Scheme
      // TODO 7: create DataFrame view

      val t1 = System.nanoTime
      var valid_command = true
      command match {

        // TODO 8: count-all SQL

        // TODO 9: time-filter SQL

        // TODO 10: avg-bytes-by-code SQL
      
        case _ => valid_command = false
      }
      val t2 = System.nanoTime
      if (valid_command) {
        println(s"Command '$command' on file '$inputfile' finished in ${(t2 - t1) * 1E-9} seconds")
        if (!spark.sparkContext.master.startsWith("local")) {
          println("Press Enter to exit (you can access http://localhost:4040 while this is running)...")
          StdIn.readLine()
        }
      }
      else
        Console.err.println(s"Invalid command '$command'")
    } finally {
      spark.stop
    }
  }
}
```

Note: To create a new Scala object, check the following instructions.

  1. Right click your package name in the project browser. Select `New`, then select `Scala Class`.

      ![New Scala class](images/new-scala-class.png)

  2. In the popped up `Create New Scala Class` dialog, type `AppSQL`, then select `Object`.

      ![New Scala object](images/new-scala-object.png)

      *Note*: A Scala object is a Singleton class with one object instantiated automatically. All methods inside the object are treated as static methods.


### III. Read and parse the input file (Part B) (10 minutes) (In home)

Spark SQL is equipped with a CSV parser that can read semi-structured CSV files.

1. Copy and Complete `TODO 5` with the following code:
    ```scala
    val input = // TODO 5: -- read input file as a Spark DataFrame
    input.show()
    // TODO 6: print the DataFrame Scheme
    // TODO 7: create DataFrame view
    ```
    
2. You can use the following code to read input file as a Spark DataFrame:
    ```scala
    val input = spark.read.format("csv")
        .option("sep", "\t")
        .option("inferSchema", "true")
        .option("header", "true")
        .load("nasa_19950801.tsv") // TODO 5.a
    ```

3.  The output should look similar to the following:

    ```text
    +--------------------+-------+---------+------+--------------------+--------+------+-------+---------+
    |                host|logname|     time|method|                 url|response| bytes|referer|useragent|

    only showing top 20 rows
    ```

2. The `option("sep", "\t")` configures the reader with the tab separator so there is no need to manually split each line.
3. The `option("header", "true")` will do two things. First, it will skip the first line in the file so that you do not have to manually remove it. Second, it will use the column names in that line to access the attribute so you do not need to access them by number.
4. The `option("inferSchema", "true")` tells Spark to infer the schema based on the values in the file. For example, the time will be parsed as an integer number which allows the use of range comparison.
5. To check the inferred schema, add the following statement.
* Complete `TODO 6` with the following code:

    ```scala
    input.printSchema()
    ```

    The output should look similar to the following:

    ```text
    root
    |-- host: string (nullable = true)
    |-- logname: string (nullable = true)
    |-- time: integer (nullable = true)
    |-- method: string (nullable = true)
    |-- url: string (nullable = true)
    |-- response: integer (nullable = true)
    |-- bytes: integer (nullable = true)
    |-- referer: string (nullable = true)
    |-- useragent: string (nullable = true)
    ```

  One main difference between the Spark RDD and SparkSQL is that SparkSQL requires dataframes to have a known strucutre (a schema) that is used to optimize how it answers your query.

6. Comment the line `option("inferSchema", "true")` only, and run your program again.
    * ***(Q2) What is the type of the attributes `time` and `bytes` this time? Why?***

7. To use SQL queries, you should add the following line to create a view named `log_lines` that points to your input.
  * Complete `TODO 7` with the following code:
    ```scala
    input.createOrReplaceTempView("log_lines")
    ```

This makes your table viewable by Spark SQL so you can run SQL queries on it.

### IV. Query the Dataframe using Dataframe Operators (45 minutes) (In-lab)

In this part, we will run some relational operators through the Dataframe/SparkSQL API. The logic of these queries is similar to what we did in part A. This will allow you to compare and contrast the two APIs.

Note: For each of the following, you are free to use SQL queries directly or build the query using the Dataframe API. Instructions for both are given for each command.

0. Copy and complete the following code to `TODO 8`:
    ```scala
    case "count-all" =>
      // Count total number of records in the file
      val query: String = "" // TODO 8 -- SQL count number of records in input
      val count: Long = spark.sql(query).first().getAs[Long](0)
      println(s"Total count for file '$inputfile' is $count")
    ```

1. The command `count-all` is implemented using the `count` function.
    * Complete `TODO 8` using `spark.sql()` function:

      You can also run this logic using the following SQL function:

      ```SQL
      SELECT count(*) FROM log_lines;
      ```

      The following code snippet shows how to run this SQL query in your code.

      ```scala
      val count = spark.sql(
        """SELECT count(*)
          FROM log_lines""")
        .first()
        .getAs[Long](0)
      ```

      Notice that the return value of any SQL query is always a Dataframe even if it contains a single row or a single value.

      *Note*: An alternative way to call functions in Scala is using spaces instead of dot and parantheses. The following syntax is valid.

      ```scala
      val queryResult = spark sql "SELECT count(*) FROM log_lines" first
      val count = queryResult.getAs[Long](0)
      ```

      You can use this alternative syntax wisely to make your code more readable 
      without being too complex to follow.

2. You can run by `B1.count-all` or passing arguments `count-all nasa_19950801.tsv`. The output should be the same as in Part A.(#iv-count-all-and-code-filter-10-minutes).

3. The command `time-filter` should count all the records that happened in a time interval `[from, to]`. The two parameters are provided as the third and forth command line arguments. You will use the `filter` function but this time with the `between` expression. Again, you can just provide the filter predicate as a string, i.e., `"time BETWEEN 807274014 AND 807283738"`, or as a Scala expression, i.e., `$"time".between(807274014, 807283738)`. This will be followed by `count` to count the records.
    * Copy and complete `TODO 9` with the following code:
      ```scala
      case "time-filter" => // Filter by time range [from = args(2), to = args(3)], and print the total number of matching lines
        val from: Long = args(2).toLong
        val to: Long = args(3).toLong
        val query: String = "" // TODO 9 --  SQL to filter and count number of records
        val count: Long = spark.sql(query).first().getAs[Long](0)
        println(s"Total count for file '$inputfile' in time range [$from, $to] is $count")
      ```

4. Run the code with `B2.time-filter`, or passing arguments `time-filter nasa_19950801.tsv 807274014 807283738`. The output should be the same as in Part A.

    You can also use the following SQL query.

    ```SQL
    SELECT count(*)
    FROM log_lines
    WHERE time BETWEEN <from> AND <to>;
    ```

    You should replace `<from>` and `<to>` with the correct parameters passed through command line. You can use the [string interpolation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/scala-book/two-notes-about-strings.html) feature in Scala to keep your code readable.

5. To implement the command `avg-bytes-by-code` you will first need to group records by response code using the `groupBy` function, i.e., `groupBy("response")` or `groupBy($"response")`. On the result, you should call the correct aggregate function, i.e., `count`, `sum`, or `avg`. The last two functions take a parameter which is the column name to aggregate, e.g., `sum("bytes")`. You can finally print the result using the `show()` command.
    * Copy and Complete `TODO 10` with the following code:
      ```scala
        case "avg-bytes-by-code" => // Group the liens by response code and calculate the average bytes per group
          println(s"Average bytes per code for the file '$inputfile'")
          println("Code,Avg(bytes)")
          val query: String = "" // TODO 10 -- SQL to get average bytes by response code
          spark.sql(query).collect().foreach(row => println(s"${row.get(0)},${row.get(1)}"))
      ```

6. Run the code with `B3.avg-bytes-by-code` or passing arguments `avg-bytes-by-code nasa_19950801.tsv`, The output should be the same as in Part A.

    Here is one SQL query that you can further customize for the three commands.

    ```SQL
    SELECT response, AVG(bytes)
    FROM log_lines
    GROUP BY response
    ORDER BY response;
    ```

## Part C. Running in Distributed Mode (In-lab Group Activity)

This part will be done in your `cs167` server.

In this part, we will run the part the computes the `avg-bytes-by-code` using both implementations on the cluster. We will learn some differences about how Spark processes them.

### I. Start an HDFS and Spark Clusters (5 minutes)

1. Start an HDFS cluster with your group, refer to [Lab 3](../Lab1/CS167-Lab3.md). for instructions.

2. Start a Spark cluster with your group, refer to [Lab 5](../Lab1/CS167-Lab5.md). for instructions.

3. Make the user folder in HDFS is initialized and contains the file `nasa_19950630.22-19950728.12_[UCRNet_ID].tsv`

    *Note*: You can use `hdfs dfs -ls` to check whether the file exists. If not, use `hdfs dfs -put nasa_19950630.22-19950728.12_[UCRNet_ID].tsv`

### II. Run Your Program in Distributed Mode

1. Run the part based on the RDD implementation first:
```bash
spark-submit --class edu.ucr.cs.cs167.[UCRNetID].App --master spark://class-###:7077 [UCRNetID]_lab6-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar avg-bytes-by-code nasa_19950630.22-19950728.12_[UCRNetID].tsv
```

Note, you can add ` 2>/dev/null` at the end of your command to get clean output without any logs.

2. While the program is still running, visit [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040) in your web browser and answer the following questions.


    * ***(Q3) How many jobs does your program have? List them here, and describe what each job is performing.***

    * ***(Q4) How many stages does your program have? Why does it have two stages for the countByKey job?***

    * ***(Q5) What are the longest two stages? Why do you think they are the longest?***

    * ***(Q6) Copy the output of the command including the code, and Avg(bytes) table, as well as the runtime.***

3. Run the Spark SQL version of the same program, you can use the following command:

```bash
spark-submit --class edu.ucr.cs.cs167.[UCRNetID].AppSQL --master spark://class-###:7077 [UCRNetID]_lab6-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar avg-bytes-by-code nasa_19950630.22-19950728.12_[UCRNetID].tsv
```

The only difference between this command and the previous one is that we are using the `AppSQL` class instead.


4. While the program is still running, visit [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040) in your web browser and answer the following questions.

  * ***(Q7) How many jobs does your program have? List them here, and describe how they compare to the previous program***
    Note if you still have the command that shows the table and prints the schema you might see a different number. It is better to comment those lines. These lines are `input.show()` and `input.printSchema()`.
  * ***(Q8) How many stages does your program have? How did the number of stages affect the run time? Is this program slower or faster?***

  * ***(Q9) Visit this link [http://localhost:4040/SQL](http://localhost:4040/SQL), on that page click on the `collect at AppSQL`. Observe the graph which represents how your query was processed. Then, scroll to the end of bottom of the page, and click on `> Details`. You will notice two parts `+- == Final Plan ==` and `+- == Initial Plan ==`. Copy those plans here, and discuss. Which plan is longer and more complicated? Which plan do you think is more optimal? ***


This should help you get an idea about the benefits of Spark SQL compared to using the low level RDD API. With Spark SQL, the processer has information about your data like its schema, and can dynamically optimize your queries as it processes them, like detecting if your data is not distributed well across the worker nodes (skewed data). However, when using the RDD API, typically the program will follow the transformations and aggregations you provided. In our case, our implementation for computing the average was not optimal.

## Commands

You can use the following commands for testing.

```bash
# Part A
spark-submit --class edu.ucr.cs.cs167.[UCRNetID].App --master "local[*]" target/[UCRNetID]_lab6-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar count-all nasa_19950801.tsv
spark-submit --class edu.ucr.cs.cs167.[UCRNetID].App --master "local[*]" target/[UCRNetID]_lab6-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar time-filter nasa_19950801.tsv 807274014 807283738
spark-submit --class edu.ucr.cs.cs167.[UCRNetID].App --master "local[*]" target/[UCRNetID]_lab6-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar avg-bytes-by-code nasa_19950801.tsv

# Part B
spark-submit --class edu.ucr.cs.cs167.[UCRNetID].AppSQL --master "local[*]" target/[UCRNetID]_lab6-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar count-all nasa_19950801.tsv
spark-submit --class edu.ucr.cs.cs167.[UCRNetID].AppSQL --master "local[*]" target/[UCRNetID]_lab6-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar time-filter nasa_19950801.tsv 807274014 807283738
spark-submit --class edu.ucr.cs.cs167.[UCRNetID].AppSQL --master "local[*]" target/[UCRNetID]_lab6-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar avg-bytes-by-code nasa_19950801.tsv
```

Hint: Add `2>/dev/null` to the end of each command to hide logging information from Spark.
