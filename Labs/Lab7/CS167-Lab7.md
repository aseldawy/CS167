## Lab Work

### I. Setup MongoDB, Database Tools and MongoDB shell in your cs167 machine (15 minutes, In-home)
1. Login to your CS167 machine.
2. On your CS167 machine, download and extract `MongoDB Community Edition` with version `8.0.4` to your `$HOME/cs167` using the command below:
    ```shell
    curl https://fastdl.mongodb.org/linux/mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu2204-8.0.4.tgz | tar -xvz -C $HOME/cs167
    ```
3. Download and extract `MongoDB Database Tools` with version `100.11.0` to your $HOME/cs167 using the command below:
    ```shell
    curl https://fastdl.mongodb.org/tools/db/mongodb-database-tools-ubuntu2204-x86_64-100.11.0.tgz | tar -xvz -C $HOME/cs167
    ```
4. Download and extract `MongoDB Shell` with version `2.3.9` to your $HOME/cs167 using the command below:
    ```shell	
    curl https://downloads.mongodb.com/compass/mongosh-2.3.9-linux-x64.tgz | tar -xvz -C $HOME/cs167
    ```

*Note:* You should see the following three folders created in your `$HOME/cs167` folder after step 4:
+ mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu2204-8.0.4
+ mongodb-database-tools-ubuntu2204-x86_64-100.11.0
+ mongosh-2.3.9-linux-x64

5. Use the following command to copy all the files from the `~/cs167/mongodb-database-tools-ubuntu2204-x86_64-100.11.0/bin` directory to the `~/cs167/mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu2204-8.0.4/bin` directory:
    ```shell
    cp -r $HOME/cs167/mongodb-database-tools-ubuntu2204-x86_64-100.11.0/bin/* $HOME/cs167/mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu2204-8.0.4/bin/
    ```
<!-- Available files are:
    + bsondump
    + mongoexport
    + mongoimport
    + mongostat
    + mongodump
    + mongofiles
    + mongorestore
    + mongotop -->

6. Use the following command to copy all the files from  the `~/cs167/mongosh-2.3.9-linux-x64/bin` directory to the `~/cs167/mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu2204-8.0.4/bin` directory. 
    ```shell
    cp -r $HOME/cs167/mongosh-2.3.9-linux-x64/bin/* $HOME/cs167/mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu2204-8.0.4/bin/
    ```
<!-- Available files are:
    + mongosh 
    + mongosh_crypt_v1.so -->

7. Setup `environment variables` for MongoDB using the following command:
    ```shell
    echo 'export MONGODB_HOME=$HOME/cs167/mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu2204-8.0.4' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$MONGODB_HOME/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

8. Reload the configuration by running:
    ```shell
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

9. Test that MongoDB works correctly by running the command:
    ```shell
    mongod -version
    ```
    The output should look something like the following:
    ```text
    db version v8.0.4
    Build Info: {
        "version": "8.0.4",
        "gitVersion": "bc35ab4305d9920d9d0491c1c9ef9b72383d31f9",
        "openSSLVersion": "OpenSSL 3.0.2 15 Mar 2022",
        "modules": [],
        "allocator": "tcmalloc-google",
        "environment": {
            "distmod": "ubuntu2204",
            "distarch": "x86_64",
            "target_arch": "x86_64"
        }
    }
    ```

10. Use the following command to create a `$MONGODB_HOME/data` directory where your data will be stored:
	```shell
    mkdir -p $MONGODB_HOME/data
    ```
11. Start the `MongoDB server` by running the following command in `screen` or `tmux`, or `keep the tab/window open` while doing this lab:
    ```shell
    mongod --dbpath $MONGODB_HOME/data
    ```
<!-- *Note*: It is recommended to run the **mongod** service in a [screen](../../remote-access.md#part-vii-run-commands-in-a-screen) so it stays running in case you lose your connection. If this is too complicated for you, just keep the window open. If you get disconnected, you will need to rerun the **mongod** service again using the command above. -->

### II. Data Understanding (15 minutes - In Home)

In this part, you will work with the [`tweets.json`](tweets.json) file to better understand it.

1. Upload [`tweets.json`](./tweets.json) to your `cs167` virtual machine home directory (you can drag the file into `vscode` if you are connecting with `cs167` by `vscode`).
2. On your `cs167 machine`, start a new `Spark shell in local mode` by running:
    ```shell
    spark-shell --master local
    ```
    
    Wait a few seconds, you should be able to see the following information:
    ```shell
    Spark context Web UI available at http://class-###.cs.ucr.edu:4040
    Spark context available as 'sc' (master = local, app id = local-1739417507414).
    Spark session available as 'spark'.
    Welcome to

    Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
    Type :help for more information.

    scala> 
    ```
3. Once the Spark shell starts, run the command:
    ```shell
    spark.read.json("file:///home/cs167/tweets.json").printSchema
    ```
    *Note*: We explicitly use the local file system (`file:///`) to override your existing configuration from previous labs.

* ***(Q1) What is the schema of the file? Copy it to the README file and keep it for your reference.***  

4. Leave `spark-shell` by typing:
    ```shell
    :q
    ```

### III. Data Manipulation (60 minutes)

For this part, you can use `generative AI tools` to help you get familiar with `MongoDB` interfaces. Attach your conversation in your submission for grading.

1. Start a new terminal on your `cs167 machine`, import the sample file into a new collection named `tweets`. You will need to use [`mongoimport`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongoimport/) command from the database tool with [`--collection`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongoimport/#std-option-mongoimport.--collection) option.
* ***(Q2) What is your command to import the `tweets.json` file?*** 
* ***(Q3) What is the output of the import command?*** 

2. On your CS167 machine, start a `MongoDB Shell` by running the command:
    ```shell
    mongosh
    ```
    You should see the following content:
    ![Mongo Shell](images/mongosh-terminal.png)

    `MongoDB Shell` is an `interactive JavaScript interface` to MongoDB. Here, you can run queries, manage data, and perform administrative tasks directly in your MongoDB database.

3. You can use the following command to list all available `MongoDB` databases:
    ```shell
    show dbs
    ```
    And use the following command to switch to the db you store `tweets`:
    ```shell
    use [db name]
    ```

4. Write a query in the MongoDB shell to count the total number of records in the `tweets` collection.
* ***(Q4) What is your command to count the total number of records in the `tweets` collection and what is the output of the command?***

5. Find all tweets those have `country_code` "JP" and user's `statuses_count` is greater than 50,000. From these tweets, list information about the users, specifically their username (`user_name`), number of followers (`followers_count`), and total number of tweets (`statuses_count`). The results should be sorted in *ascending order* based on the number of followers (`followers_count`).
* ***(Q5) What is your command for this query?*** 
* ***(Q6) How many records does your query return?*** (Use the [db.collection.count()](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.count/) function to answer this question.)
    
    Hint: You can `provide the AI tools with some sample data` so that it can better understand the data format. You will need to use [db.collection.find()](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#mongodb-method-db.collection.find), [projection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#projection) and [Ascending/Descending Sort](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/cursor.sort/#ascending-descending-sort). Check how to [access nested attributes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#embedded-field-specification).

5. Repeat what you did for Q5 but [do not show the `_id` field](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.find/#_id-field-projection).
* ***(Q7) What is the command that retrieves the results without the _id field?*** 

6. Insert the following document into the collection.
    ```javascript
    {id: Long('921633456941125634'), place: { country_code: 'JP', name: 'Japan', place_type: 'city' }, user: {user_name: 'xyz2', followers_count: [2100, 5000], statuses_count: 55000}, hashtags: ['nature' ],lang: 'ja'}
    ```
* ***(Q8) What is the command to insert the sample document? What is the result of running the command?*** 
* ***(Q9) Does MongoDB accept this document while the followers_count field has a different type than other records?*** 

    Hint: Use [`db.collection.insertOne()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.insertOne/#db.collection.insertone--).

7. Insert the following document into the collection.

    ```javascript
    {id: Long('921633456941121354'), place: { country_code: 'JP', name: 'Japan', place_type: 'city' }, user: {user_name: 'xyz3', followers_count: {last_month: 550, this_month: 2200}, statuses_count: 112000}, hashtags: [ 'art', 'tour' ], lang: 'ja'
    }
    ```
* ***(Q10) What is your command to insert this record?***

8. Now go back to step 5, which lists the records in Japan and with followers larger than 50,000. This time, sort the results by followers_count in **descending** order.
* ***(Q11) Where did the two new records appear in the sort order?***
    + Note: write the answer in the form: user name "xyz2" is the first/last/or between followers_count {} and {}. user name "xyz3" is the first/last/or between followers_count {} and {}. 

* ***(Q12) Why did they appear at these specific locations?***

    Check the [documentation of MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/bson-type-comparison-order/) to help you answer this question.

9. Now go back to step 5, but this time lists the records sorted by followers_count in **ascending** order.
* ***(Q13) Where did the two records appear in the ascending sort order? Explain your observation.***

    Hint: [Ascending/Descending Sort](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/cursor.sort/#ascending-descending-sort).


10. Build an index on the `user.followers_count` field for the `tweets` collection.
* ***(Q14) Is MongoDB able to build the index on that field with the different value types stored in the `user.followers_count` field?***
* ***(Q15) What is your command for building the index?***
* ***(Q16) What is the output of the create index command?***

    Hint: Use [`db.collection.createIndex()`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/#mongodb-method-db.collection.createIndex).

### IV.  Identify Tweets with Selected Hashtags
In this part, you need to find all tweets that include any of the following hashtags: 'job', 'hiring', or 'IT'. The query should return the tweet text (text field), the associated hashtags, and the associated user's user_name, followers_count for each matching document in the **ascending** order of user's follower's count. 
* ***(Q17) What is your command for this query?***
* ***(Q18) How many records are returned from this query?***

*Hint:* : Use the [`$in`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/in/) operator within your query to specify that you want to find documents where the hashtags array contains at least one of the specified hashtags.

---
### V. Print top 5 countries with most number of tweets
For this part, you need to run a query on `tweets` collection which will return the top 5 countries with most number of tweets. List the country_code and tweets_count in the descending order of the tweets_count. Use the [db.collection.aggregate()](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.aggregate/#db.collection.aggregate--) framework stages to group documents by the country code, count the number of tweets for each country, sort these counts, and then limit the results to only the top 5 countries.
* ***(Q19) What is your command for this query?***
* ***(Q20) What is the output of the command?***
---
### VI. Print the Top 5 Trending Hashtags from Tweets
Write a MongoDB aggregation pipeline to determine the top 5 most frequently used hashtags in the tweets collection. The results should be sorted by the frequency of each hashtag in descending order. 
+ Begin by breaking down the array of hashtags so each one can be analyzed individually. Use [`$unwind`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/) on the `hashtags` column in the aggregate pipeline. 
+ Then, group by `hashtags`, count the occurrences of each, and order the results to find the most common hashtags. Finally, limit the output to show only the top 5 hashtags.
* ***(Q21) What is your command for this query?***
* ***(Q22) What is the output of the command?***
---
### VII. Test MongoDB Index Performance
In this part, you will test the performance of MongoDB by building different types of indexes and compare their performance. 

1. Download [Tweets_100k.json](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Cn_E45y0kVXZZRlb7BE9n6F7pwhrcPvZ), upload the `.bz2` file to your `cs167` home directory. Decompress it by the following command:
    ```shell
    bzip2 -d Tweets_100k.json.bz2
    ```

2. Import `Tweets_100k.json` to MongoDB. You can use the command in Part III.1 (use `mongoimport`. You can specify the db name by using `--db` option).

3. You can list all databases by using:
    ```javascript
    show dbs
    ```
    You can switch to the database you just created for `Tweets_100k.json` by using:
    ```javascript
    use [Your DB Name]
    ```

4. You can use the following command to show all indexes for current database:
    ```javascript
    db.tweets.getIndexes()
    ```
* ***(Q23) Are there any existing indexes? Explain your answer.***

5. You can use the following piece of code to find all tweets contain word `happy` using regex expression (case insensitive):
    ```javascript
    var start = new Date();
    var result = db.tweets.find({
        text: { $regex: "\\bhappy\\b", $options: "i" }
    }).toArray();  
    var end = new Date();
    print("Query time for regex search 'happy': " + (end - start) + "ms");
    print("Total result count: " + result.length);
    ```

6. Now, build a Text Index (a type of index in MongoDB for text) for `text` field in `tweets` collection by following command:
    ```javascript
    db.tweets.createIndex({ "text": "text" })
    ```

7. Write a query which use text index to find all tweets contain word happy, and measure its running time.
* ***(Q24) What's the running time of the second query? Comparing to Q23, it is faster or slower?***

8. You can show the detailed explaination for query execution. For example, you can use the following code to show detailed information for running regex:
    ```javascript
    db.tweets.find({
        text: { $regex: "\\bhappy\\b", $options: "i" }  
    }).explain("executionStats") 
    ```
    You can find the following fields:
    ```json
    winningPlan: {
        isCached: false,
        stage: 'COLLSCAN',
        filter: { text: { '$regex': '\\bhappy\\b', '$options': 'i' } },
        direction: 'forward'
    },
    rejectedPlans: []
    ...
    executionStages: {
        isCached: false,
        stage: 'COLLSCAN',
        filter: { text: { '$regex': '\\bhappy\\b', '$options': 'i' } },
        nReturned: 760,
        executionTimeMillisEstimate: 150,
        works: 100001,
        advanced: 760,
        needTime: 99240,
        needYield: 0,
        saveState: 8,
        restoreState: 8,
        isEOF: 1,
        direction: 'forward',
        docsExamined: 100000
    }
    ```
* ***(Q25) What do winningPlan and COLLSCAN mean?***

9. Now, try `.explain("executionStats")` for your `text index-based` query.
* ***(Q26) What is the winningPlan? Did your query use the text index?***
* ***(Q27) You may notice that the nReturned of your query does not match the regex query. Do some explornations and explain why.***
